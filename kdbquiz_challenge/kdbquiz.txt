    KDB+ questions in a predefined table/dictionary 

Problem Definition: 

This problem is to create a kdb+ quiz system that sends out kdb questions to its users at timed intervals, can receive each user’s answer to correct, and tallies up the scores to finally present a winner at the end of the quiz.  

The idea is to have this quiz system to be set up on a port such that the users can connect to it, and it would be comprised of methods that would provide the full functionality. These methods would be that the process can send questions to the users on a timed basis, can handle the answers that are received back from the users by comparing them to the right answers, and functionality to keep track of each user’s score to be able to provide a scoreboard at the end. The end result will be a quiz system that can be started by a command and will run fully through by itself to the presentation of the end scores. 

Tasks 

- Set up a process on a port that the users can connect to. 
- Create a table that will track information of the connected users to the quiz. 
- Send the questions from a predefined table/dictionary to the users at set time intervals. 
- Handle the user input such that they will type into the console, and it will be sent to server automatically. 
- Collect the answers in a table. 
- At the end total up the scores and send back the results to every user.
