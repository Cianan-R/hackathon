Trade Report 

Resources required: 

    fakedb.q script  

    fxrates.csv and symstatic.csv files 

Problem definition: 

This challenge will have several requirements, with the end goal of creating a script 
that will query a database and generate a report as a csv file. As a prerequisite you will 
need to start a q process, create a HDB using the fakedb.q script, and set the process 
listening on a port where the HDB is loaded in. You should also download tradereport.zip and extract it into your working directory. The tradereport folder contains two CSV files; symstatic and fxrates, that the script will need to load in. 

Deliver functionality which can, with a user input of two dates: 

    Open a connection to the HDB process. If the connection fails, return an error message “Failed to connect to HDB:” along with a string of the error result. 

    Query the HDB via IPC for the range of inputted dates, returning ntrade (number of trades), total size traded and turnover (sum of price X size) by date and sym from the trades table.  

    Join the table loaded in from the symstatic.csv file onto the table above (The column types for the symstatic.csv should be symbol, string and symbol respectively). 

    Load the fxrates.csv file into a table with column types; date, symbol and float respectively and again join onto the table above by date and curr (Note that fxrates only contains fx rates for EUR and GBP -> set rateUSD  to be 1 where the sym’s currency is already in USD). 

    Generate a trade report table by converting the turnover to USD. 

    Finally, save the trade report as a CSV file, and add functionality to send an email with the trade report attached.  

Optional extras: 

    Add logging messages including the current timestamp and a brief description of the steps above. 

    Modify the script to save the CSV file as tradereport_YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.csv where the dates appended are the start and end dates provided.
