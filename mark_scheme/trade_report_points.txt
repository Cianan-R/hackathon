trade report ( 1pt each )
• input 2 dates; a start date and end date from command line.
• Logging solution
• You should have 2 q processes; one HDB and one process for reporting. (see this by the querying)
• Querying between the reporting process and HDB should be performed over IPC
• When your report process attempts to connect to the HDB it should have error trapping to report 
back if the connection fails
• The HDB will house raw historical data, queries on it should return for each date and sym:
	o ntrade (number of trades)
	o size (Total size traded)
	o turnover (price*size)
• You need to generate the turnover in USD
	o Load in the 2 provided csv files and join their data appropriately
	o Perform the necessary calculations.
• Trade report table should include fx rates and any static information provided.
• Trade report should be saved out to disk with (./traderport/tradereport.csv) as a csv file with 
	column names (case sensitive): date,sym,description,curr,ntrades,size,turnoverUSD.
	
2.2.2 The optional extras ( 1 pt each )
• Check the date input and if there aren’t 2 dates, query across a set, hardcoded range
• Modify your functionality to output the report as tradereport_<start date>_<end date>.csv
• Can you create a better looking report that doesn’t use csv?
• Can you have the report emailed leveraging kdb+ commands?

2.2.3 Bonus path ( 2 pts each )
Data Intellect are also willing to offer additional kudos to challengers who:
• .Q.opt
• Logging over levels e.g info, error, fatal?
• Error capture utilized where feasible
